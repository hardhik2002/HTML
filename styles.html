<p style="color:blue;font-family:verdana;font-size:150%;text-align:center;"><!--here we defined color means text color-->Ernesto "Che" Guevara (Spanish: 
[ˈtʃe ɣeˈβaɾa];[3] 14 June 1928[4] – 9 October 1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, 
physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. A major figure of 
the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of 
rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.[5]

As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was radicalized 
by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed.[6][7] His burgeoning desire to help overturn 
what he saw as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his 
involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, whose eventual 
CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidified Guevara's political 
ideology.[6] Later in Mexico City, Guevara met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July 
Movement, and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with the intention of overthrowing 
U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.[8] Guevara soon rose to prominence among the 
insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the two-year 
guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.[9
